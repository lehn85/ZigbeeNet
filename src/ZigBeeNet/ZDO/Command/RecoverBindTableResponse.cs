    * Recover Bind Table Response value object class.

    * The Recover_Bind_Table_rsp is generated from a backup binding table cache
    * device in response to a Recover_Bind_Table_req from a primary binding table
    * cache and contains the Status of the request. This command shall be unicast to the
    * requesting device. If the responding device is not a backup binding table cache, it
    * shall return a Status of NOT_SUPPORTED. If the originator of the request is not
    * recognized as a primary binding table cache it shall return a Status of
    * INV_REQUESTTYPE. Otherwise, the backup binding table cache shall prepare a
    * list of binding table entries from its backup beginning with StartIndex. It will fit in
    * as many entries as possible into a Recover_Bind_Table_rsp command and return a
    * Status of SUCCESS. If StartIndex is more than the number of entries in the
    * Binding table, a Status of NO_ENTRY is returned. For a successful response,
    * BindingTableEntries is the total number of entries in the backup binding table, and
    * BindingTableListCount is the number of entries which is being returned in the
    * response.
