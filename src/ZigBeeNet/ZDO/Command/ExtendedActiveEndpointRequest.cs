    * to acquire the list of endpoints on a remote device with simple descriptors. This
    * command shall be unicast either to the remote device itself or to an alternative
    * device that contains the discovery information of the remote device. The
    * Extended_Active_EP_req is used for devices which support more active
    * endpoints than can be returned by a single Active_EP_req.
    * <br>
    * The NWKAddrOfInterest field shall contain the network address of the remote device for
    * which the active endpoint list is required. The StartIndex field shall be set in the
    * request to enable retrieval of lists of active endpoints from devices whose list exceeds
    * the size of a single ASDU and where fragmentation is not supported.
