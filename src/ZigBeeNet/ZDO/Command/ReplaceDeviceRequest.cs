    * Replace Device Request value object class.
    * 
    * The Replace_Device_req is intended for use by a special device such as a
    * Commissioning tool and is sent to a primary binding table cache device to change
    * all binding table entries which match OldAddress and OldEndpoint as specified.
    * Note that OldEndpoint = 0 has special meaning and signifies that only the address
    * needs to be matched. The endpoint in the binding table will not be changed in this
    * case and so NewEndpoint is ignored. The processing changes all binding table
    * entries for which the source address is the same as OldAddress and, if
    * OldEndpoint is non-zero, for which the source endpoint is the same as
    * OldEndpoint. It shall also change all binding table entries which have the
    * destination address the same as OldAddress and, if OldEndpoint is non-zero, the
    * destination endpoint the same as OldEndpoint. The destination addressing mode
    * for this request is unicast.
